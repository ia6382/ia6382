[**WHCA\* in OpenRA**](https://github.com/ia6382/OpenRA)
* My CS master's thesis
* An implementation of the seminal multi-agent pathfinding algorithm WHCA* in an open source real-time strategy game engine OpenRA
* Tests the claims of scientific research that the algorithm is very suitable for use in RTS games
* As far as I know this is the only implementation of any WHCA*-like algorithm in a real-time game environment
* C#, LUA, Python, Batch, Visual Studio

[**RTS Pathfinding**](https://github.com/ia6382/rts-pathfinding)
* Implementation and testing of several RTS single-agent pathfinding algorithms in a game environment
* Created a prototype RTS game with ASCII graphics for testing
* Python, libtcod, VS Code

* Result of the Outfit7 talent camp I attended in 2018 - a two week summer workshop hosted in Ljubljana 
* Made a 3D rythm based mobile game as a team of 8 people (4 programmers, 2 artists and a game designer)
* Published on Google Play after further polishing and company's framework integration
* I programmed the level generation with a parallax scrolling background I was in charge of the Unity project itself: \
I worked close with the artists to give them our requirenments and intergrated their assets into the project and connected them to varius scripts made by myself and other programmers
* I really enjoyed collaborating with the artists, learning about their tools and complementing each others skills to create amazing art such as particle effects and the cell shading effect
* Helped the company with their framework integration in Android Studio - made the loading screen with a tip of the day, loading bar and a custom background made by the artists
* C#, Java, Unity, Android Studio, Git

[**Game Production Masterclass**](https://sloveniagames.com/game-production-masterclass/)
* An end-to-end video game production online course
* I attended 14 lectures by experienced mentors from the industry on topics such as: game production phases, studio managment,\
game design, idea testing, PR & marketing, prototyping, asset pipeline, vertical slice, analytics, monetization, fundraising, publishing
* Every lecture came with a homework and feedback was given to us by the mentor. 
* Based on my performance I was one of the few who recieved the certificate of achievment and was invited to \
give a short presentation on my game projects and my RTS game pathfinding research at the final networking event in person
